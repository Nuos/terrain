Hello,

In the first part of the project, we have to create a FBO to store the texture. In the tutorial you gave us, it is said that we have to "set the list of draw buffers". They're doing this like so:
GLenum DrawBuffers[1] = {GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0};
glDrawBuffers(1, DrawBuffers);


I don't understand the purpose of the glDrawBuffers. Isn't enough to attach our texture to the FBO with  glFramebufferTexture(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, ourTexture, 0)? What does the glDrawBuffers function do?

Thank you in advance,

CÃ©line

Hi,

In your case it is not necessary to use it. If you wanted to write to several texture's at once, you could simultaneously activate 2 or more different color attachments (e.g., for writing the depth to one for writing normals to another one). You don't have to change anything here since, by default, color attachment 0 is the only active draw buffer when a FBO is bound.

Note that in pracitcal 6, draw buffer was set to GL_NONE. That means that we didn't want to write any color but only update the depth buffer (for the shadow map). In this case it's the opposite way, we want two write to color attachment 0 but we don't need any depth buffer.

Does this help?

Thank you for your answer! It is clearer now.
