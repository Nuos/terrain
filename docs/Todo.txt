correct heightmap bug
heightmap scaling
compute normal map ahead of time, then combine with heightmap in a vec4 texture
better sampler object management : glBindSampler
light position linked in Terrain and Shadowmap

Water reflection: Pierre can you continue with this? I will assist you as well since I am having some ideas for it. 
Wave equation: More realistic wave animation should be good. I will be in charge of this. 
Complete shadow map
L-system, level of detail, infinite detail, time of the day
I want to add some tree or human or ship into our terrain. So when we moving around the camera in stage 3, it would be impressive to see various scenes.


Done
----

correct normal computation --> done by Alex
use OO paradigm --> done by Michaël, can still be improved
refactor in functions and compilation units --> done by Michaël
find good terrain --> done by Pierre, can still be improved
    [Alex] The terrain is good. I still like the one with choice = 3
